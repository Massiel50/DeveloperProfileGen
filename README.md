 This program is created to ask the user a series of questions in the terminal, It then generates a pdf profile from the data received. 

   The command will ask for their favorite color and Github name. An api request will get information from the git api,like an image, how many repo's in the git account, stars, occupation and location. The profile will generate with the picture and nicely place the data in an organized and pretty format.
